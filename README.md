# collocation
in situ and satellite collocation


First attempt at collaboration via github

Goals/outline:

1. Download in situ data in the Beaufort - e.g. UpTempO, SWIFT, SIZRS.
2. Load corresponding SMAP data for the same dates
3. Plot maps with SMAP and in situ data
4. Do some collocation statistics (scatterplots) of SSS
5. Add sea ice to maps
6. Do steps 2-5 for SST
